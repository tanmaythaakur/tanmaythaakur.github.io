I am delighted to announce that the famous geek portal <a target="_blank" href="https://geeksforgeeks.org"> GeeksforGeeks</a> has published my three articles on a budding computer language Golang.  
The articles revolve around mathematical concepts such as *trailing zeros in factorial of a number* and language-oriented ones like *return values of a function*.  
It required me to learn a whole new programming language and explore its powers and applications in the technical world. Having learned a few new concepts that are unique to this very language, writing articles was a challenging part as Martin Flower once said,  

> *"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand"*

The documentation and code comments were a little more challenging than the code itself.
Having managed to do so, I now would like you to take a look at the articles.
