It was a usual monotonous night in home-quarantine, and I, tired of watching programming tutorials on YouTube, decided to sleep early. About to close my Chrome which had dozens of tabs open, I stumbled upon a video thumbnail that popped up out of nowhere in my recommendations. It was a picture of a couple romancing on a train door, and underneath that "Pal full video - Jalebi" was written.

I, 10 out of 10 times, do not click on such gooey and romantic videos, but what intrigued me was the term "Jalebi" written in the title which had nothing to do with the thumbnail and the title. That's where things begin to change. That curiosity made me look at things I usually ignored. After playing that song, I opened another tab to search for the movie. "Jalebi" was its name, and it was a love story (YUCK!! but wait.....). I don't know whether it was boredom or the lack of new content to my brain (or maybe because it was 10 pm and I had nothing to watch *shruggie*), I decided to watch it.  I am the kind of person who hates love and loves space and nature (YEET!). But everything in this movie was different.   
It wasn't gooey. It was beyond beautiful. It had everything that one can see and feel emotional and happy. It wasn't one of the boring two-people-love-then-they-get-separated-then-they-somehow-meet kind of BS. Filled with a man's loyalty, a woman's desire to pursue her dreams,  and the cuteness of a 7-year-old girl, this was no ordinary love story. It showed me that love is something that's not in the words but the actions taken not once, but for years or as one may say, forever. A life-long commitment, not necessarily to be a part of someone's life, but to remember them forever.   
It made me change my perspective in the context of love. Maybe love exists, maybe people care for each other after years of apartness/togetherness, maybe they care, maybe their bond is as sweet as "Jalebi" or maybe I should stop writing reviews of movies that try to change my mind and make me believe in love and write something technical XD.  

P.s: It is the only love story I liked.
